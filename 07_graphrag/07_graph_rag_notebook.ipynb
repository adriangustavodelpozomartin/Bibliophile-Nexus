    "### De los RAG a los GraphRAG\n",
    "\n",
    "La generación aumentada por recuperación (RAG) es un enfoque establecido para responder preguntas de usuarios sobre colecciones privadas de documentos. Sin embargo, los RAG's están diseñados para situaciones donde las respuestas se encuentran localmente en regiones de texto, es decir, cuando la información necesaria para responder una pregunta se puede encontrar en fragmentos específicos y delimitados del texto, en lugar de estar dispersa o requerir la síntesis de múltiples partes del documento. De este modo, una vez que se han identificado y recuperado estos fragmentos relevantes de texto, éstos contienen suficiente información para que el modelo pueda generar una respuesta adecuada. Este enfoque tiene un problema muy evidente: mostrará un desempeño muy pobre en preguntas generales tales como *\"¿Cuáles son los principales temas de este documento?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "En los últimos años, el campo del procesamiento del lenguaje natural (NLP) ha experimentado una transformación significativa, especialmente en lo que respecta a las tareas de resumen de texto. Tradicionalmente, se hacían distinciones claras entre diferentes tipos de resúmenes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- abstractivos vs. extractivos\n",
    "- genéricos vs. enfocados en consultas\n",
    "- de documento único vs. de múltiples documentos\n",
    "\n",
    "Sin embargo, estas categorías han perdido relevancia en la actualidad. La razón principal es el avance tecnológico en los modelos de lenguaje. Inicialmente, la arquitectura *transformer* mostró mejoras sustanciales en todas estas tareas de resumen. Pero el verdadero salto cualitativo vino con los LLMs, tales como GPT, Llama o Gemini.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Avances en Modelos de Lenguaje\n",
    "\n",
    "Estos LLMs han simplificado enormemente las tareas de resumen. Para ello, utilizan una técnica llamada \"aprendizaje en contexto\". Esto significa que pueden adaptar su comprensión y generación de texto basándose en el contexto proporcionado, sin necesidad de entrenamiento adicional. En la práctica, esto implica que estos modelos pueden realizar cualquier tipo de resumen independientemente de si es abstractivo o extractivo, genérico o específico, de un solo documento o de varios. Todo lo que necesitan es que el contenido a resumir esté dentro de su \"ventana de contexto\", es decir, la cantidad de texto que pueden procesar de una vez.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problemas en Resúmenes de Grandes Corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "A pesar de estos progresos, aún existen problemas importantes a tratar. Uno de los más notables corresponde al resumen abstractivo enfocado en consultas (query-focused abstractive summarization) cuando se trata de trabajar con corpus de texto muy extensos. Podríamos decir que hay tres razones fundamentales al tratar con este tipo de resúmenes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Limitaciones de contexto en LLMs:** Los LLMs tienen una capacidad limitada para procesar texto, conocida como \"ventana de contexto\". Cuando se trata de resumir grandes volúmenes de texto, como corpus enteros de documentos, esta limitación se vuelve evidente.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **El problema de \"perderse en el medio\":** Incluso si se ampliara la ventana de contexto de los LLMs, surge un nuevo problema: la información puede \"perderse en el medio\" de contextos más largos. Esto significa que el modelo puede tener dificultades para mantener la coherencia y relevancia a lo largo de textos muy extensos.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Insuficiencia del RAG tradicional:** El RAG en su forma básica, que implica recuperar fragmentos de texto directamente, no es adecuada para tareas de resumen enfocado en consultas (QFS) a gran escala. Esto se debe a que la información relevante puede estar dispersa en todo el corpus y no concentrada en fragmentos específicos.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GraphRAG: Una Solución Innovadora\n",
    "\n",
    "Para responder a estos problemas, surge GraphRAG (Generación Aumentada por Recuperación basada en Grafos), que se fundamenta en la creación de resúmenes globales a partir del grafo de conocimiento generado por un LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "La elección del uso de grafos de conocimiento es natural debido principalmente a dos razones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Su modularidad. Esta propiedad se refiere a la capacidad de los grafos para organizarse naturalmente en grupos o módulos.\n",
    "- La existencia de algoritmos para la detección de comunidades, tales como Louvain o Leiden, que nos van a permitir dividir el grafo en comunidades de nodos estrechamente relacionados. Estas comunidades representan grupos de información interconectada.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Estrategia Map-Reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "Una vez halladas estas comunidades, se utilizará un LLM para generar resúmenes de las descripciones de éstas. De esta manera, será posible realizar resúmenes enfocados en consultas de un corpus completo, empleamos una estrategia de *map-reduce*:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Map:** Cada resumen de comunidad se utiliza para responder a la consulta de forma independiente y en paralelo.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reduce:** Luego, sintetizamos todas las respuestas parciales relevantes en una respuesta global final.\n",
    "\n",
    "Este método permite abordar el problema de resumir grandes volúmenes de texto de manera eficiente y efectiva, superando las limitaciones de contexto de los LLMs y aprovechando la estructura natural de la información representada en forma de grafo.\n"

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Ahora vamos a desglosar el flujo de datos del enfoque **GraphRAG** descrito en [@graphrag2024].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentos Fuente → *Text Chunks*\n",
    "\n",
    "Una decisión fundamental en el diseño de este sistema es determinar la granularidad con la que los textos extraídos de los documentos fuente deben dividirse en fragmentos para su procesamiento. Esta decisión afecta directamente a la eficiencia del sistema: fragmentos más largos requieren menos llamadas a los modelos de lenguaje, pero pueden perder precisión, mientras que fragmentos más cortos ofrecen mayor detalle pero son más costosos de procesar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Text Chunks* → Instancias de Elementos\n",
    "\n",
    "En esta etapa, el objetivo es identificar y extraer nodos y aristas del grafo a partir de cada fragmento de texto. Esto se logra mediante un prompt de LLM en varias partes que identifica entidades (con nombre, tipo y descripción) y sus relaciones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Un aspecto clave es que, para mejorar la eficiencia y calidad, se implementa un sistema de “recolección” múltiple, en el que el LLM revisa si se han extraído todas las entidades posibles. Si se detectan entidades faltantes, se realiza una extracción adicional. Este enfoque permite usar fragmentos de texto más grandes sin perder calidad en la extracción.\n",
    "\n",
    "Además, se pueden extraer covariables adicionales, como afirmaciones vinculadas a las entidades detectadas, incluyendo detalles como sujeto, objeto, tipo, descripción o fechas relevantes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instancias de Elementos → Resúmenes de Elementos\n",
    "\n",
    "En esta fase se utiliza un LLM para extraer descripciones de entidades, relaciones y afirmaciones representadas en los documentos. Este proceso ya es una forma de resumen abstractivo, ya que el LLM crea resúmenes significativos de conceptos que pueden estar implícitos pero no explícitamente mencionados en el texto.\n",
    "\n",
    "Para convertir todos estos resúmenes a nivel de instancia en bloques únicos de texto descriptivo para cada elemento del grafo (es decir, nodos de entidad y aristas de relación), se requiere una ronda adicional de resumen por parte del LLM sobre grupos coincidentes de instancias, es decir, aquellos que se refieren al mismo elemento o concepto en el texto fuente.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resúmenes de Elementos → *Graph Communities*\n",
    "\n",
    "En esta etapa, se transforman los resúmenes de elementos obtenidos en la fase anterior en una estructura de grafo. Así, el índice creado en la etapa anterior se modela como un grafo homogéneo no dirigido y ponderado. En dicho grafo:\n",
    "- **Nodos:** Representan las entidades.\n",
    "- **Aristas:** Representan las relaciones entre entidades, con un peso basado en la frecuencia normalizada de las relaciones detectadas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Además, se aplican algoritmos de detección de comunidades para dividir el grafo en grupos de nodos más fuertemente conectados entre sí que con el resto del grafo. Esto permite identificar estructuras y patrones significativos en los datos. Concretamente, se usa el algoritmo **Leiden**, que permite obtener una jerarquía de comunidades, donde cada nivel proporciona una partición que cubre todos los nodos del grafo de manera mutuamente exclusiva.\n",
    "\n",
    "Esta estructura jerárquica permite un enfoque de “divide y vencerás” para el resumen global, haciendo posible procesar y sintetizar información de grandes corpus de manera más eficiente.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Graph Communities* → Resúmenes de Comunidad\n",
    "\n",
    "El siguiente paso en el proceso de GraphRAG es la creación de resúmenes estructurados para cada comunidad de la jerarquía de Leiden. Este método está diseñado para ser escalable a conjuntos de datos muy grandes y nos permite:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Obtener una comprensión global de la estructura y semántica del conjunto de datos.\n",
    "- Explorar el corpus de información sin necesidad de formular preguntas específicas.\n",
    "- Facilitar la navegación temática, permitiendo explorar temas generales y profundizar en subtemas de interés.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generación de Resúmenes de Comunidades\n",
    "\n",
    "El proceso de generación de resúmenes se adapta según el nivel jerárquico de la comunidad.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comunidades de Nivel Hoja**\n",
    "\n",
    "Para las comunidades en el nivel más bajo de la jerarquía:\n",
    "- *i.* Se priorizan los resúmenes de elementos (nodos, aristas y covariables) de la comunidad. La priorización sigue este orden:\n",
    "  - Se ordenan las aristas de la comunidad según la suma de los grados de sus nodos fuente y destino.\n",
    "  - Para cada arista, se añaden las descripciones del nodo fuente, nodo destino, covariables vinculadas y la propia arista.\n",
    "- *ii.* Estos resúmenes se añaden iterativamente a la ventana de contexto del LLM hasta alcanzar el límite de tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comunidades de Nivel Superior**\n",
    "\n",
    "Para las comunidades en niveles más altos de la jerarquía:\n",
    "- Si todos los resúmenes de elementos caben en la ventana de contexto, se procede como en las comunidades de nivel hoja.\n",
    "- Si no caben, se sigue este proceso:\n",
    "  - Se ordenan las subcomunidades de mayor a menor según la cantidad de tokens de sus resúmenes de elementos.\n",
    "  - Se sustituyen iterativamente los resúmenes de elementos, que son más largos, por los resúmenes de subcomunidades, de menor extensión, hasta que todo quepa en la ventana de contexto.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resúmenes de Comunidad → Respuestas de Comunidad → Respuesta Global\n",
    "\n",
    "La fase final del pipeline de GraphRAG se centra en la generación de una respuesta global a partir de los resúmenes de las comunidades. Este proceso se divide en tres etapas principales:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preparación de los Resúmenes de Comunidades**  \n",
    "   Los resúmenes de las comunidades se reorganizan de manera aleatoria y se dividen en *chunks* de un tamaño predeterminado. Este enfoque:\n",
    "   - Asegura que la información relevante se distribuya uniformemente entre los fragmentos.\n",
    "   - Evita que información crucial se concentre en una sola ventana de contexto, lo que podría resultar en la pérdida de datos importantes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generación de Respuestas Intermedias**  \n",
    "   Para cada *chunk* de texto, se generan respuestas intermedias de forma paralela utilizando el LLM, que:\n",
    "   - Crea una respuesta basada en cada *chunk*.\n",
    "   - Asigna una puntuación de 0 a 100 a cada respuesta, indicando su relevancia para la pregunta del usuario.\n",
    "   - Filtra y elimina las respuestas con puntuación 0, consideradas no relevantes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Síntesis de la Respuesta Global**  \n",
    "   Finalmente, se construye la respuesta global mediante un proceso de reducción:\n",
    "   - Las respuestas intermedias se ordenan de mayor a menor según su puntuación de relevancia.\n",
    "   - Se van añadiendo a una nueva ventana de contexto hasta alcanzar el límite de tokens establecido.\n",
    "   - Utilizando este contexto final, se genera la respuesta global que se presentará al usuario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Así, este enfoque multietapa permite a GraphRAG proporcionar respuestas más completas y contextualizadas, aprovechando la estructura de conocimiento generada en las fases anteriores del pipeline. En la [Figura 1](#fig-pipeline), se muestra un resumen gráfico del proceso descrito.\n",

However, this ghost also took him away from the city to an open country road before returning him. Thus, Scrooge's experiences in the city are intertwined with his supernatural encounters.\",\n",

However, throughout the story, Scrooge undergoes a significant transformation. After being visited by various spirits, including the ghost of Jacob Marley, his former business partner, and the Ghost of Christmas Past, Scrooge changes his ways. He is seen celebrating Christmas Day, buying a turkey for Bob Cratchit, and visiting his nephew's house. He also promises to raise Bob Cratchit's salary and assist his family, becoming a better person in the process [Data: Entities (33); Relationships (144, 158, 132, 134)].\\n\\n## Role of Ghosts in Scrooge's Transformation\\n\\nThe Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come play a significant role in Scrooge's transformation. These spectral entities visit Scrooge, showing him scenes from his past, present, and potential future. The purpose of these visits is to provide Scrooge with a comprehensive view of his life, allowing him to reflect on his past actions and decisions, and to show him the potential consequences of his current lifestyle.

Despite being dead, Marley visits Scrooge as a ghost, warning him about his life choices and the consequences of his actions. Marley's spectral presence and his concern for Scrooge's fate indicate a deep connection between the two, possibly as past associates or friends [Data: Entities (81, 34); Relationships (132, 100)].\\n\\n## Scrooge's Workplace and Employee\\n\\nScrooge's workplace, the counting-house, and his employee, the clerk, are also important entities in the community.

This interaction provides insight into Scrooge's initial character and his attitude towards Christmas [Data: Entities (212, 49); Relationships (113, 208)].\\n\\n## Scrooge's Interaction with Other Entities\\n\\nScrooge interacts with various other entities throughout the story, including the portly gentlemen, the boy in Sunday clothes, and the Poulterer's.

There is no doubt whatever about that.\\nThe register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the\\nundertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's name\\nwas good upon 'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old\\nMarley was as dead as a door-nail.\\n\\nMind! I don't mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is\\nparticularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself,\\nto regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the\\ntrade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my\\nunhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country's done for. You\\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\\ndead as a door-nail.\\n\\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\\nScrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge\\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\\nit with an undoubted bargain.\\n\\nThe mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started\\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died\\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul's Churchyard, for\\ninstance--literally to astonish his son's weak mind.\\n\\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years\\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\\nwas all the same to him.\\n\\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his</td>\n",

       "      <td>-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\\ndog-days, and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.\\n\\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The\\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often 'came down'\\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\\n\\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, 'My\\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?' No beggars\\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\\no'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to\\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\\nsaid, 'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!'\\n\\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call 'nuts' to Scrooge.\\n\\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\\nand was brewing on a large scale.\\n\\nThe door of Scrooge's counting-house was open, that he might keep his\\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire\\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't\\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\\n\\n'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!' cried a cheerful voice. It was\\nthe voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\\n\\n'Bah!' said Scrooge. 'Humbug!'\\n\\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\\nnephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\\n\\n'Christmas a humbug, uncle!' said Scrooge's nephew. 'You don't mean\\nthat, I am sure?'\\n\\n'I do,' said Scrooge. 'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.'\\n\\n'Come, then,' returned the nephew gaily. 'What right have you to be\\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.'\\n\\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\\n'Bah!' again; and followed it up with 'Humbug!'\\n\\n'Don't be cross, uncle!' said the nephew.\\n\\n'What else can I be,' returned the uncle, 'when I live in such a world\\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's\\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\\nbalancing your books</td>\n",

Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's\\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\\nbalancing your books, and having every item in 'em through a round dozen\\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,' said\\nScrooge indignantly, 'every idiot who goes about with \"Merry Christmas\"\\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!'\\n\\n'Uncle!' pleaded the nephew.\\n\\n'Nephew!' returned the uncle sternly, 'keep Christmas in your own way,\\nand let me keep it in mine.'\\n\\n'Keep it!' repeated Scrooge's nephew. 'But you don't keep it.'\\n\\n'Let me leave it alone, then,' said Scrooge. 'Much good may it do you!\\nMuch good it has ever done you!'\\n\\n'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\\nhave not profited, I dare say,' returned the nephew; 'Christmas among\\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and\\nnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\\nbless it!'\\n\\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\\nlast frail spark for ever.\\n\\n'Let me hear another sound from _you_,' said Scrooge, 'and you'll keep\\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You're quite a powerful\\nspeaker, sir,' he added, turning to his nephew. 'I wonder you don't go\\ninto Parliament.'\\n\\n'Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.'\\n\\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\\nextremity first.\\n\\n'But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew. 'Why?'\\n\\n'Why did you get married?' said Scrooge.\\n\\n'Because I fell in love.'\\n\\n'Because you fell in love!' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only\\none thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. 'Good\\nafternoon!'\\n\\n'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give\\nit as a reason for not coming now?'\\n\\n'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.\\n\\n'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be\\nfriends?'\\n\\n'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.\\n\\n'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never\\nhad any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial\\nin homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last.\\nSo A Merry Christmas, uncle!'\\n\\n'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.\\n\\n'And A Happy New Year!'\\n\\n'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.\\n\\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He\\nstopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the\\nclerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\\nthem cordially.\\n\\n'There's another fellow,' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: 'my\\nclerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking\\nabout a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.'\\n\\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people\\nin. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with\\ntheir hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their\\nhands, and bowed to him.\\n\\n'Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,' said one of the gentlemen, referring\\nto his list. 'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.\\nMarley?'\\n\\n'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,' Scrooge replied. 'He died\\nseven years ago, this very night.'\\n\\n'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving\\npartner,' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\\n\\n[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]\\n\\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous\\nword 'liberality' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the\\ncredentials back.\\n\\n'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scro</td>\n",

There is no doubt whatever about that.\\nThe register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the\\nundertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's name\\nwas good upon 'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old\\nMarley was as dead as a door-nail.\\n\\nMind! I don't mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is\\nparticularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself,\\nto regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the\\ntrade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my\\nunhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country's done for. You\\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\\ndead as a door-nail.\\n\\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\\nScrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge\\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\\nit with an undoubted bargain.\\n\\nThe mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started\\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died\\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul's Churchyard, for\\ninstance--literally to astonish his son's weak mind.\\n\\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years\\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names.

Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\\ndog-days, and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.\\n\\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The\\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often 'came down'\\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\\n\\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, 'My\\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?' No beggars\\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\\no'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to\\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\\nsaid, 'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!'\\n\\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call 'nuts' to Scrooge.\\n\\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\\nand was brewing on a large scale.\\n\\nThe door of Scrooge's counting-house was open, that he might keep his\\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire\\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't\\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\\n\\n'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!' cried a cheerful voice. It was\\nthe voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\\n\\n'Bah!' said Scrooge. 'Humbug!'\\n\\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\\nnephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\\n\\n'Christmas a humbug, uncle!' said Scrooge's nephew. 'You don't mean\\nthat, I am sure?'\\n\\n'I do,' said Scrooge. 'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.'\\n\\n'Come, then,' returned the nephew gaily. 'What right have you to be\\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.'\\n\\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\\n'Bah!' again; and followed it up with 'Humbug!'\\n\\n'Don't be cross, uncle!' said the nephew.\\n\\n'What else can I be,' returned the uncle, 'when I live in such a world\\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's\\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\\nbalancing your books   \n",

Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's\\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\\nbalancing your books, and having every item in 'em through a round dozen\\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,' said\\nScrooge indignantly, 'every idiot who goes about with \"Merry Christmas\"\\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!'\\n\\n'Uncle!' pleaded the nephew.\\n\\n'Nephew!' returned the uncle sternly, 'keep Christmas in your own way,\\nand let me keep it in mine.'\\n\\n'Keep it!' repeated Scrooge's nephew. 'But you don't keep it.'\\n\\n'Let me leave it alone, then,' said Scrooge. 'Much good may it do you!\\nMuch good it has ever done you!'\\n\\n'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\\nhave not profited, I dare say,' returned the nephew; 'Christmas among\\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and\\nnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\\nbless it!'\\n\\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\\nlast frail spark for ever.\\n\\n'Let me hear another sound from _you_,' said Scrooge, 'and you'll keep\\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You're quite a powerful\\nspeaker, sir,' he added, turning to his nephew. 'I wonder you don't go\\ninto Parliament.'\\n\\n'Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.'\\n\\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\\nextremity first.\\n\\n'But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew. 'Why?'\\n\\n'Why did you get married?' said Scrooge.\\n\\n'Because I fell in love.'\\n\\n'Because you fell in love!' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only\\none thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. 'Good\\nafternoon!'\\n\\n'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give\\nit as a reason for not coming now?'\\n\\n'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.\\n\\n'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be\\nfriends?'\\n\\n'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.\\n\\n'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never\\nhad any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial\\nin homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last.\\nSo A Merry Christmas, uncle!'\\n\\n'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.\\n\\n'And A Happy New Year!'\\n\\n'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.\\n\\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He\\nstopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the\\nclerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\\nthem cordially.\\n\\n'There's another fellow,' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: 'my\\nclerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking\\nabout a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.'\\n\\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people\\nin. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with\\ntheir hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their\\nhands, and bowed to him.\\n\\n'Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,' said one of the gentlemen, referring\\nto his list. 'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.\\nMarley?'\\n\\n'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,' Scrooge replied. 'He died\\nseven years ago, this very night.'\\n\\n'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving\\npartner,' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\\n\\n[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]\\n\\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous\\nword 'liberality' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the\\ncredentials back.\\n\\n'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scro   \n",

There is no doubt whatever about that.\\nThe register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the\\nundertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge\\'s name\\nwas good upon \\'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old\\nMarley was as dead as a door-nail.\\n\\nMind! I don\\'t mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is\\nparticularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself,\\nto regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the\\ntrade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my\\nunhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country\\'s done for. You\\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\\ndead as a door-nail.\\n\\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\\'t know how many years. Scrooge\\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\\nit with an undoubted bargain.\\n\\nThe mention of Marley\\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\\'s father died\\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\\'s Churchyard, for\\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\\'s weak mind.\\n\\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\\'s name. There it stood, years\\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\\nwas all the same to him.\\n\\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his', entity_ids=['ce62fb5eacf74c18a8d6b7417a028b47', '87845a23037848d9b58e0be1539a1ab3', '7f32030293ab434eb8c5730ed22c41c8', 'd43a4bf0218041a6a0d39fa269891322', 'b7fde61247a54514a9482ae2a9b4efae', '07983dc4ae694ee6beade2959a611354', '27d3bbc17fb6423b933d0263b178ec1a', 'bd6d54a7a8d94de1bded3c5807a933ad', 'd9f4a9704b20480db8b8c4e3899a3751', 'e9829f782df6461691c81a1b206ef95a', '5c6faac584694fc094a9552e25452149', 'a576fece771e4165b738d532bce5b66a', 'd99b325cde304d31bcdb16ba4cd3abbf', '1fbdeede6a0449fe8b295ed5cfba6cd3'], relationship_ids=['bbd1bb9e7bca472e80b37960694a882f', '7943536f667640b79b7aec77eca9748a', '7e15bcf26eee414289be20ff13434bea', '8b8abfd8da2340b6a1fb4253419c81c8', '8e7b10cd2540402c99a3dc5cbb07b61b', '3b183b6002c54888af6712e4daaa2fe3', '82ffa2ba82964352b71f9eef693a5d62', 'a0d5844ea436452cac765c27db8e86ed', '47aa79ed2d5c4bbba126f9d115acf905', '74c9bb75e92d416a974d6716ebb9a038'], covariate_ids=None, n_tokens=1200, document_ids=['c305886e4aa2f6efcf64b57762777055'], attributes=None),\n",

Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\\ndog-days, and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.\\n\\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The\\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often 'came down'\\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\\n\\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, 'My\\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?' No beggars\\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\\no'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to\\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\\nsaid, 'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!'\\n\\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call 'nuts' to Scrooge.\\n\\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\\nand was brewing on a large scale.\\n\\nThe door of Scrooge's counting-house was open, that he might keep his\\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire\\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't\\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\\n\\n'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!' cried a cheerful voice. It was\\nthe voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\\n\\n'Bah!' said Scrooge. 'Humbug!'\\n\\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\\nnephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\\n\\n'Christmas a humbug, uncle!' said Scrooge's nephew. 'You don't mean\\nthat, I am sure?'\\n\\n'I do,' said Scrooge. 'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.'\\n\\n'Come, then,' returned the nephew gaily. 'What right have you to be\\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose?

The ancient tower of a church,\\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\\nas they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke:\\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household\\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\\nstirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\\n\\nFoggier yet, and colder!

He lived in chambers which had\\nonce belonged to his deceased partner.

It was old enough now, and\\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\\nthreshold.\\n\\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\\nlast mention of his seven-years'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\\nMarley's face.\\n\\nMarley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\\nits own expression.\\n\\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\\n\\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\\nbe untrue.

Nobody under\\nthe table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and\\nbasin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his\\nhead) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody\\nin his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\\nagainst the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two\\nfish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in\\nhis dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against\\nthe wall_]\\n\\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double\\nlocked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against\\nsurprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,\\nand his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.\\n\\nIt was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was\\nobliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract\\nthe least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace\\nwas an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all\\nround with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.\\nThere were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters, Queens of Sheba,\\nAngelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like\\nfeather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in\\nbutter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that\\nface of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet's rod,\\nand swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at\\nfirst, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the\\ndisjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of\\nold Marley's head on every one.\\n\\n'Humbug!' said Scrooge; and walked across the room.\\n\\nAfter several turns he sat down again. As he threw his head back in the\\nchair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that\\nhung in the room, and communicated, for some purpose now forgotten, with\\na chamber in the highest storey of the building. It was with great\\nastonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable dread, that, as he\\nlooked, he saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in the\\noutset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and\\nso did every bell in the house.\\n\\nThis might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an\\nhour.

Upon its coming\\nin, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, 'I know him! Marley's\\nGhost!' and fell again.\\n\\nThe same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat,\\ntights, and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his\\npigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he\\ndrew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like\\na tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes,\\nkeys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His\\nbody was transparent: so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking\\nthrough his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.\\n\\nScrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had\\nnever believed it until now.\\n\\nNo, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through\\nand through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling\\ninfluence of its death-cold eyes, and marked the very texture of the\\nfolded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not\\nobserved before, he was still incredulous, and fought against his\\nsenses.\\n\\n'How now!' said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. 'What do you want\\nwith me?'\\n\\n'Much!'--Marley's voice; no doubt about it.\\n\\n'Who are you?'\\n\\n'Ask me who I _was_.'\\n\\n'Who _were_ you, then?' said Scrooge, raising his voice. 'You're\\nparticular, for a shade.' He was going to say '_to_ a shade,' but\\nsubstituted this, as more appropriate.\\n\\n'In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.'\\n\\n'Can you--can you sit down?' asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him.\\n\\n'I can.'\\n\\n'Do it, then.'\\n\\nScrooge asked the question, because he didn't know whether a ghost so\\ntransparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt\\nthat in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the\\nnecessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the Ghost sat down on the\\nopposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.\\n\\n'You don't believe in me,' observed the Ghost.\\n\\n'I don't,' said Scrooge.\\n\\n'What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your own\\nsenses?'\\n\\n'I don't know,' said Scrooge.\\n\\n'Why do you doubt your senses?'\\n\\n'Because,' said Scrooge, 'a little thing affects them. A slight disorder\\nof the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef,\\na blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato.\\nThere's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!'\\n\\nScrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel in\\nhis heart by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be\\nsmart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his\\nterror; for the spectre's voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones.\\n\\nTo sit staring at those fixed, glazed eyes in silence, for a moment,\\nwould play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him. There was something\\nvery awful, too, in the spectre's being provided with an infernal\\natmosphere of his own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was\\nclearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its\\nhair, and skirts, and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour\\nfrom an oven.\\n\\n'You see this toothpick?' said Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge,\\nfor the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a\\nsecond, to divert the vision's stony gaze from himself.\\n\\n'I do,' replied the Ghost.\\n\\n'You are not looking at it,' said Scrooge.\\n\\n'But I see it,' said the Ghost, 'notwithstanding.'\\n\\n'Well!' returned Scrooge, 'I have but to swallow this, and be for the\\nrest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own\\ncreation. Humbug, I tell you: humbug!'\\n\\nAt this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such\\na dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair,\\nto save himself from falling in a swoon.

It is a\\nponderous chain!'\\n\\nScrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding\\nhimself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable; but he\\ncould see nothing.\\n\\n'Jacob!' he said imploringly. 'Old Jacob Marley, tell me more! Speak\\ncomfort to me, Jacob!'\\n\\n'I have none to give,' the Ghost replied. 'It comes from other regions,\\nEbenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of\\nmen. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all\\npermitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere.\\nMy spirit never walked beyond our counting-house--mark me;--in life my\\nspirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole;\\nand weary journeys lie before me!'\\n\\nIt was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his\\nhands in his breeches pockets.

'And travelling all the time?'\\n\\n'The whole time,' said the Ghost. 'No rest, no peace. Incessant torture\\nof remorse.'\\n\\n'You travel fast?' said Scrooge.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n'On the wings of the wind,' replied the Ghost.\\n\\n'You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,'\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\\nThe Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so\\nhideously in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have\\nbeen justified in indicting it for a nuisance.\\n\\n'Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,' cried the phantom, 'not to know\\nthat ages of incessant labour, by immortal creatures, for this earth\\nmust pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is\\nall developed!

He had been quite familiar with one old ghost in\\na white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who\\ncried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an\\ninfant, whom it saw below upon a doorstep. The misery with them all was\\nclearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and\\nhad lost the power for ever.\\n\\nWhether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he\\ncould not tell.

Scrooge demanded.\\n\\n'I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.'\\n\\n'Long Past?' inquired Scrooge, observant of its dwarfish stature.\\n\\n'No. Your past.'\\n\\nPerhaps Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if anybody could have\\nasked him; but he had a special desire to see the Spirit in his cap,\\nand begged him to be covered.\\n\\n'What!' exclaimed the Ghost, 'would you so soon put out, with worldly\\nhands, the light I give? Is it not enough that you are one of those\\nwhose passions made this cap, and force me through whole trains of years\\nto wear it low upon my brow?'\\n\\nScrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge\\nof having wilfully 'bonneted' the Spirit at any period of his life. He\\nthen made bold to inquire what business brought him there.\\n\\n'Your welfare!' said the Ghost.\\n\\nScrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not help thinking that\\na night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end. The\\nSpirit must have heard him thinking, for it said immediately--\\n\\n'Your reclamation, then. Take heed!'\\n\\nIt put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him gently by the\\narm.\\n\\n'Rise! and walk with me!'\\n\\nIt would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and the\\nhour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes; that bed was warm, and the\\nthermometer a long way below freezing; that he was clad but lightly in\\nhis slippers, dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon\\nhim at that time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman's hand, was not\\nto be resisted. He rose; but, finding that the Spirit made towards the\\nwindow, clasped its robe in supplication.\\n\\n'I am a mortal,' Scrooge remonstrated, 'and liable to fall.'\\n\\n'Bear but a touch of my hand _there_,' said the Spirit, laying it upon\\nhis heart, 'and you shall be upheld in more than this!'\\n\\nAs the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon\\nan open country road, with fields on either hand. The city had entirely\\nvanished. Not a vestige of it was to be seen. The darkness and the mist\\nhad vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow\\nupon the ground.\\n\\n'Good Heaven!' said Scrooge, clasping his hands together, as he looked\\nabout him. 'I was bred in this place. I was a boy here!'\\n\\nThe Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch, though it had been\\nlight and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man's sense\\nof feeling. He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air,\\neach one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and\\ncares long, long forgotten!\\n\\n'Your lip is trembling,' said the Ghost. 'And what is that upon your\\ncheek?'\\n\\nScrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it was a\\npimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would.\\n\\n'You recollect the way?' inquired the Spirit.\\n\\n'Remember it!' cried Scrooge with fervour; 'I could walk it blindfold.'\\n\\n'Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!' observed the Ghost.\\n'Let us go on.'\\n\\nThey walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every gate, and post,\\nand tree, until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its\\nbridge, its church, and winding river. Some shaggy ponies now were seen\\ntrotting towards them with boys upon their backs, who called to other\\nboys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys were\\nin great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the broad fields were\\nso full of merry music, that the crisp air laughed to hear it.\\n\\n'These are but shadows of the things that have been,' said the Ghost.\\n'They have no consciousness of us.'\\n\\nThe jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named\\nthem every one.

Nor was it more retentive of its ancient\\nstate within; for, entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the\\nopen doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and\\nvast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the\\nplace, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by\\ncandle light and not too much to eat.\\n\\nThey went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back\\nof the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare,\\nmelancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and\\ndesks.

As to _her_, she\\nwas worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term. If that's not\\nhigh praise, tell me higher, and I'll use it. A positive light appeared\\nto issue from Fezziwig's calves. They shone in every part of the dance\\nlike moons. You couldn't have predicted, at any given time, what would\\nbecome of them next. And when old Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone\\nall through the dance; advance and retire, both hands to your partner,\\nbow and curtsy, cork-screw, thread-the-needle, and back again to your\\nplace: Fezziwig 'cut'--cut so deftly, that he appeared to wink with his\\nlegs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger.\\n\\nWhen the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs.\\nFezziwig took their stations, one on either side the door, and, shaking\\nhands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him\\nor her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the two\\n'prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died\\naway, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter\\nin the back-shop.\\n\\nDuring the whole of this time Scrooge had acted like a man out of his\\nwits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self. He\\ncorroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and\\nunderwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the bright\\nfaces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he\\nremembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon\\nhim, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.\\n\\n'A small matter,' said the Ghost, 'to make these silly folks so full of\\ngratitude.'\\n\\n'Small!' echoed Scrooge.\\n\\nThe Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were\\npouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig; and when he had done so,\\nsaid:\\n\\n'Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money:\\nthree or four, perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this praise?'\\n\\n'It isn't that,' said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking\\nunconsciously like his former, not his latter self. 'It isn't that,\\nSpirit. He has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our\\nservice light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power\\nlies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it\\nis impossible to add and count 'em up: what then? The happiness he gives\\nis quite as great as if it cost a fortune.'\\n\\nHe felt the Spirit's glance, and stopped.\\n\\n'What is the matter?' asked the Ghost.\\n\\n'Nothing particular,' said Scrooge.\\n\\n'Something, I think?' the Ghost insisted.\\n\\n'No,' said Scrooge, 'no. I should like to be able to say a word or two\\nto my clerk just now. That's all.'\\n\\nHis former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish;\\nand Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by side in the open air.\\n\\n'My time grows short,' observed the Spirit. 'Quick!'\\n\\nThis was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he could see, but\\nit produced an immediate effect. For again Scrooge saw himself. He was\\nolder now; a man in the prime of life. His face had not the harsh and\\nrigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care\\nand avarice. There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye,\\nwhich showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of\\nthe growing tree would fall.\\n\\nHe was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning\\ndress: in whose eyes there were tears, which sparkled in the light that\\nshone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past.\\n\\n'It matters little,' she said softly. 'To you, very little. Another idol\\nhas displaced me; and, if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come\\nas I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.'\\n\\n'What Idol has displaced you?' he rejoined.\\n\\n'A golden one.'\\n\\n'This is the even-handed dealing of the world!' he said. 'There is\\nnothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is nothing it\\nprofesses to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth!'\\n\\n'You fear the world too much,' she answered gently. 'All your other\\nhopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid\\nreproach.

Show me no\\nmore!'\\n\\nBut the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms, and forced him\\nto observe what happened next.\\n\\nThey were in another scene and place; a room, not very large or\\nhandsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful\\nyoung girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same,\\nuntil he saw _her_, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter.\\nThe noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more\\nchildren there than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;\\nand, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not forty\\nchildren conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting\\nitself like forty. The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but\\nno one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed\\nheartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to\\nmingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most\\nruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of them! Though I\\nnever could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn't for the wealth of all\\nthe world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the\\nprecious little shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul!\\nto save my life.

Without venturing for Scrooge quite\\nas hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was\\nready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing\\nbetween a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\\n\\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means\\nprepared for nothing; and consequently, when the bell struck One, and no\\nshape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five\\nminutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.\\nAll this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze\\nof ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\\nhour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen\\nghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at;\\nand was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an\\ninteresting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the\\nconsolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you\\nor I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the\\npredicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would\\nunquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that\\nthe source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining\\nroom, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea\\ntaking full possession of his mind, he got up softly, and shuffled in\\nhis slippers to the door.\\n\\nThe moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by\\nhis name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\\n\\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone\\na surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with\\nliving green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which\\nbright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe,\\nand ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been\\nscattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as\\nthat dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time,\\nor Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the\\nfloor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry,\\nbrawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,\\nmince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,\\ncherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense\\ntwelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim\\nwith their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch there sat a\\njolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not\\nunlike Plenty's horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on\\nScrooge as he came peeping round the door.\\n\\n'Come in!' exclaimed the Ghost. 'Come in! and know me better, man!'\\n\\nScrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was\\nnot the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit's eyes were\\nclear and kind, he did not like to meet them.\\n\\n'I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,' said the Spirit. 'Look upon me!'\\n\\nScrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple deep green robe,\\nor mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the\\nfigure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be\\nwarded or concealed by any artifice.

Bob Cratchit\\ntold them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which\\nwould bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly. The two\\nyoung Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man\\nof business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from\\nbetween his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular\\ninvestments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that\\nbewildering income. Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner's,\\nthen told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she\\nworked at a stretch and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for\\na good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home. Also how\\nshe had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord\\n'was much about as tall as Peter'; at which Peter pulled up his collar\\nso high that you couldn't have seen his head if you had been there. All\\nthis time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-by\\nthey had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Tiny\\nTim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.\\n\\nThere was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a handsome family;\\nthey were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being waterproof;\\ntheir clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely\\ndid, the inside of a pawnbroker's. But they were happy, grateful,\\npleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they\\nfaded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit's\\ntorch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny\\nTim, until the last.\\n\\nBy this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as\\nScrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the\\nroaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms was\\nwonderful.

Here, again, were shadows on the window-blinds of\\nguests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and\\nfur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near\\nneighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them\\nenter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!\\n\\nBut, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to\\nfriendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to\\ngive them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting\\ncompany, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how\\nthe Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its\\ncapacious palm, and floated on, outpouring with a generous hand its\\nbright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very\\nlamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of\\nlight, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out\\nloudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that\\nhe had any company but Christmas.\\n\\nAnd now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a\\nbleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast\\nabout, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread\\nitself wheresoever it listed; or would have done so, but for the frost\\nthat held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse,\\nrank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\\nred, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye,\\nand frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of\\ndarkest night.\\n\\n'What place is this?' asked Scrooge.\\n\\n'A place where miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,'\\nreturned the Spirit. 'But they know me. See!'\\n\\nA light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced\\ntowards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a\\ncheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and\\nwoman, with their children and their children's children, and another\\ngeneration beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.\\nThe old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind\\nupon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song; it had been a\\nvery old song when he was a boy; and from time to time they all joined\\nin the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got\\nquite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank\\nagain.\\n\\nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and,\\npassing on above the moor, sped whither? Not to sea? To sea. To\\nScrooge's horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful\\nrange of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the\\nthundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the\\ndreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\\n\\nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore,\\non which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there\\nstood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of seaweed clung to its base,\\nand storm-birds--born of the wind, one might suppose, as seaweed of the\\nwater--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\\n\\nBut, even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that\\nthrough the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of\\nbrightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough\\ntable at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their\\ncan of grog; and one of them--the elder too, with his face all damaged\\nand scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might\\nbe--struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself.\\n\\nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on, on--until\\nbeing far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a\\nship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the\\nbow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their\\nseveral stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or\\nhad a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of\\nsome bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it.

The\\nway he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on\\nthe credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons, tumbling\\nover the chairs, bumping up against the piano, smothering himself\\namongst the curtains, wherever she went, there went he! He always knew\\nwhere the plump sister was. He wouldn\\'t catch anybody else. If you had\\nfallen up against him (as some of them did) on purpose, he would have\\nmade a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would have been an\\naffront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in\\nthe direction of the plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn\\'t\\nfair; and it really was not. But when, at last, he caught her; when, in\\nspite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him,\\nhe got her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct\\nwas the most execrable. For his pretending not to know her; his\\npretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to\\nassure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her\\nfinger, and a certain chain about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No\\ndoubt she told him her opinion of it when, another blind man being in\\noffice, they were so very confidential together behind the curtains.\\n\\nScrooge\\'s niece was not one of the blind man\\'s-buff party, but was made\\ncomfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner where\\nthe Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she joined in the\\nforfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the\\nalphabet. Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very\\ngreat, and, to the secret joy of Scrooge\\'s nephew, beat her sisters\\nhollow; though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you.\\nThere might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all\\nplayed, and so did Scrooge; for wholly forgetting, in the interest he\\nhad in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he\\nsometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed\\nright, too; for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to\\n', entity_ids=['fdee948a65da4ee5b6a3e25793dfab52', '267d767526244db6bdbabfd305b64665', 'b7fde61247a54514a9482ae2a9b4efae', '5b932f4d5c544b648d35af136acfd1af', '570173a4496b4b46a5e81f5ee799733f', '2c2f502d1ad44fa7966bf1ee46d11b47', '0afded79d65f41879975a196592e401e', '37ad1587196d4cbb84f76516a0a3086b', '486318cf9b1f4a6db9f5d9f44d0b8e92', 'e04fc15dcb884c4d9b29df42619cb091', '3885e10ac31c4aada2234e4e2716559a'], relationship_ids=['059f09b2659a4f729fd754c41750d5d3', '7d2d86bc935649748c39ddb4941e4be2', 'e1cff2a7aec64a7b90c8d90a6ad6e0fe', '3dc12ba290824592b809481bf0b21903', 'a550e8e4cb014821a0a919cbd68f121f', 'b627389ca7e94850991b48ab6b08335e', '97e033ade5ed4330a51f8873db799e63', '32e7eec8db43489093b385e6b5d718c8', 'e7249aec3b504225abffb80912590c07', '636aa3304c00466e90dfbe341f45c66e', '00c1934f933a460799bf8cd75e0a2d73'], covariate_ids=None, n_tokens=1200, document_ids=['c305886e4aa2f6efcf64b57762777055'], attributes=None),\n",

The brisk fire of questioning to\\nwhich he was exposed elicited from him that he was thinking of an\\nanimal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an\\nanimal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes and\\nlived in London, and walked about the streets, and wasn\\'t made a show\\nof, and wasn\\'t led by anybody, and didn\\'t live in a menagerie, and was\\nnever killed in a market, and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a\\nbull, or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every\\nfresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar\\nof laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that he was obliged to\\nget up off the sofa and stamp. At last the plump sister, falling into a\\nsimilar state, cried out:\\n\\n\\'I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred! I know what it is!\\'\\n\\n\\'What is it?\\' cried Fred.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s your uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge.\\'\\n\\nWhich it certainly was. Admiration was the universal sentiment, though\\nsome objected that the reply to \\'Is it a bear?\\' ought to have been\\n\\'Yes\\'; inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have\\ndiverted their thoughts from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had\\nany tendency that way.\\n\\n\\'He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure,\\' said Fred, \\'and it\\nwould be ungrateful not to drink his health.

Uncle Scrooge!\\'\\n\\nUncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart, that\\nhe would have pledged the unconscious company in return, and thanked\\nthem in an inaudible speech, if the Ghost had given him time. But the\\nwhole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his\\nnephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.\\n\\nMuch they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but\\nalways with a happy end. The Spirit stood beside sick-beds, and they\\nwere cheerful; on foreign lands, and they were close at home; by\\nstruggling men, and they were patient in their greater hope; by poverty,\\nand it was rich.

It was strange, too, that, while\\nScrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older,\\nclearly older.

When it came near him,\\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\\n\\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\\nsurrounded.\\n\\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\\n\\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\\nScrooge.\\n\\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\\n\\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\\nSpirit?'\\n\\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\\nhe received.\\n\\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\\nrecover.\\n\\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\\nheap of black.\\n\\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\\nI have seen.

Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred\\nand hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and\\nsepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a\\ncharcoal stove made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, nearly\\nseventy years of age, who had screened himself from the cold air without\\nby a frouzy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters hung upon a line and\\nsmoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.\\n\\nScrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a\\nwoman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. But she had scarcely\\nentered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; and she was\\nclosely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by\\nthe sight of them than they had been upon the recognition of each other.\\nAfter a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man with\\nthe pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh.\\n\\n'Let the charwoman alone to be the first!' cried she who had entered\\nfirst. 'Let the laundress alone to be the second; and let the\\nundertaker's man alone to be the third. Look here, old Joe, here's a\\nchance! If we haven't all three met here without meaning it!'\\n\\n'You couldn't have met in a better place,' said old Joe, removing his\\npipe from his mouth. 'Come into the parlour. You were made free of it\\nlong ago, you know; and the other two an't strangers. Stop till I shut\\nthe door of the shop. Ah! how it skreeks! There an't such a rusty bit of\\nmetal in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I'm sure there's no\\nsuch old bones here as mine. Ha! ha! We're all suitable to our calling,\\nwe're well matched. Come into the parlour. Come into the parlour.'\\n\\nThe parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The old man raked\\nthe fire together with an old stair-rod, and having trimmed his smoky\\nlamp (for it was night) with the stem of his pipe, put it into his mouth\\nagain.\\n\\nWhile he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on\\nthe floor, and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool, crossing her\\nelbows on her knees, and looking with a bold defiance at the other two.\\n\\n'What odds, then? What odds, Mrs. Dilber?' said the woman. 'Every person\\nhas a right to take care of themselves. _He_ always did!'\\n\\n'That's true, indeed!' said the laundress. 'No man more so.'\\n\\n'Why, then, don't stand staring as if you was afraid, woman! Who's the\\nwiser? We're not going to pick holes in each other's coats, I suppose?'\\n\\n'No, indeed!' said Mrs. Dilber and the man together. 'We should hope\\nnot.'\\n\\n'Very well then!' cried the woman. 'That's enough. Who's the worse for\\nthe loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose?'\\n\\n'No, indeed,' said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.\\n\\n'If he wanted to keep 'em after he was dead, a wicked old screw,'\\npursued the woman, 'why wasn't he natural in his lifetime? If he had\\nbeen, he'd have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with\\nDeath, instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself.'\\n\\n'It's the truest word that ever was spoke,' said Mrs. Dilber. 'It's a\\njudgment on him.'\\n\\n'I wish it was a little heavier judgment,' replied the woman: 'and it\\nshould have been, you may depend upon it, if I could have laid my hands\\non anything else. Open that bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value\\nof it. Speak out plain. I'm not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for\\nthem to see it.

Strike, Shadow, strike! And see his good deeds springing from the\\nwound, to sow the world with life immortal!\\n\\nNo voice pronounced these words in Scrooge's ears, and yet he heard them\\nwhen he looked upon the bed. He thought, if this man could be raised up\\nnow, what would be his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard dealing, griping\\ncares? They have brought him to a rich end, truly!\\n\\nHe lay in the dark, empty house, with not a man, a woman, or a child to\\nsay he was kind to me in this or that, and for the memory of one kind\\nword I will be kind to him.

Wonderful party, wonderful games,\\nwonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!\\n\\nBut he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was early there! If\\nhe could only be there first, and catch Bob Cratchit coming late! That\\nwas the thing he had set his heart upon.\\n\\nAnd he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No Bob. A quarter\\npast. No Bob. He was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time.\\nScrooge sat with his door wide open, that he might see him come into the\\ntank.\\n\\nHis hat was off before he opened the door; his comforter too. He was on\\nhis stool in a jiffy, driving away with his pen, as if he were trying to\\novertake nine o\\'clock.\\n\\n\\'Hallo!\\' growled Scrooge in his accustomed voice as near as he could\\nfeign it. \\'What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?\\'\\n\\n\\'I am very sorry, sir,\\' said Bob. \\'I _am_ behind my time.\\'\\n\\n\\'You are!\\' repeated Scrooge. \\'Yes, I think you are. Step this way, sir,\\nif you please.\\'\\n\\n\\'It\\'s only once a year, sir,\\' pleaded Bob, appearing from the tank. \\'It\\nshall not be repeated. I was making rather merry yesterday, sir.\\'\\n\\n\\'Now, I\\'ll tell you what, my friend,\\' said Scrooge. \\'I am not going to\\nstand this sort of thing any longer. And therefore,\\' he continued,\\nleaping from his stool, and giving Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that\\nhe staggered back into the tank again--\\'and therefore I am about to\\nraise your salary!\\'\\n\\nBob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He had a momentary\\nidea of knocking Scrooge down with it, holding him, and calling to the\\npeople in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat.\\n\\n\\'A merry Christmas, Bob!\\' said Scrooge, with an earnestness that could\\nnot be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. \\'A merrier Christmas,\\nBob, my good fellow, than I have given you for many a year! I\\'ll raise\\nyour salary, and endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will\\ndiscuss your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of\\nsmoking bishop, Bob!

He did it all, and infinitely more;\\nand to Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he was a second father. He became as\\ngood a friend, as good a master, and as good a man as the good old\\nCity knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough in the good old\\nworld. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them\\nlaugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that\\nnothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did\\nnot have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as\\nthese would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they\\nshould wrinkle up their eyes in grins as have the malady in less\\nattractive forms. His own heart laughed, and that was quite enough for\\nhim.\\n\\nHe had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the\\nTotal-Abstinence Principle ever afterwards; and it was always said of\\nhim that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed\\nthe knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as\\nTiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\\n|Transcriber\\'s note: The Contents were added by the transcriber.|\\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A CHRISTMAS CAROL ***\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\ngenerations.

The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nSection 5.

    "Este bloque de código configura todo el entorno necesario para realizar consultas mediante el enfoque GraphRAG. En primer lugar, se leen y procesan las salidas de la indexación: se cargan los datos de entidades, embeddings, reportes de comunidades y unidades de texto desde archivos Parquet, y se transforman en estructuras de datos alineadas con nuestro modelo de conocimiento.\n",
    "\n",
    "A continuación, se establece una conexión con una base de datos vectorial (LanceDB) a través de un objeto llamado `description_embedding_store`, que almacenará las representaciones vectoriales de las descripciones de las entidades. \n",
    "\n",
    "El código procede a configurar la interfaz con el API de OpenAI, definiendo el token (que en este ejemplo se deja vacío por motivos de seguridad), el modelo LLM (en este caso, GPT-4-32k) y el modelo de embeddings (text-embedding-ada-002). Se crea también un codificador de tokens mediante la biblioteca `tiktoken`, el cual es esencial para gestionar la longitud de los textos en función del límite de tokens del modelo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Con estos elementos, se construye un objeto `LocalSearchMixedContext`, que actúa como ensamblador del contexto para las consultas. Este objeto integra los reportes de comunidades, las unidades de texto, las entidades, las relaciones (y opcionalmente las covariables) junto con el almacenamiento de embeddings, lo que permite componer el contexto relevante a partir de diversas fuentes de información.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finalmente, se definen dos conjuntos de parámetros: uno para la construcción del contexto (`local_context_params`), que incluye proporciones de contribución de las diferentes fuentes y límites de tokens, y otro para el LLM (`llm_params`), con parámetros como el número máximo de tokens y la temperatura de generación. Con estos parámetros, se instancia el motor de búsqueda local (`LocalSearch`), que es el componente encargado de generar respuestas basadas en el contexto integrado, devolviendo resultados en formato de múltiples párrafos.\n",
    "\n",
    "En resumen, este código orquesta la integración de datos indexados, la conexión con la base de datos vectorial, la configuración de los modelos de OpenAI y la construcción del contexto de búsqueda, para finalmente crear un motor de búsqueda  capaz de responder consultas.\n",
