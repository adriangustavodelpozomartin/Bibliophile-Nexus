    "A continuación, vamos a desarrollar un sistema de recomendación que aprovecha el contenido textual enriquecido de nuestro dataset. Para ello, primero cargamos y preparamos el DataFrame a partir del archivo CSV 'datasets/clean_description_english.csv'. Hemos renombrado el DataFrame a `df_hf`. En este paso, combinamos información relevante —como el título, la descripción limpia, la puntuación media, las categorías y el autor— para formar una nueva columna \"description\". La idea es que esta columna consolidada nos brinde un contexto completo del libro, lo que resulta muy útil a la hora de comparar la consulta del usuario con las características de cada libro.\n",
    "\n",
    "La estrategia que seguimos consiste en utilizar modelos de SentenceTransformer para generar embeddings de cada descripción. Los embeddings son vectores numéricos que capturan el significado semántico de los textos. En nuestro caso, empleamos el modelo 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' por su eficiencia y capacidad para generar representaciones precisas de oraciones breves. Con este modelo, convertimos la columna \"description\" en una lista de strings y generamos un conjunto de embeddings, llamados `book_embeddings`, que utilizaremos para medir la similitud entre la consulta del usuario y las descripciones de los libros.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definimos la función `get_recommendations` que, dada una consulta y los embeddings de los libros, realiza los siguientes pasos:\n",
    "- Genera el embedding de la consulta utilizando el mismo modelo.\n",
    "- Calcula la similitud coseno entre el embedding de la consulta y todos los embeddings del dataset.\n",
    "- Ordena los libros en función de la similitud obtenida y devuelve los libros con mayor coincidencia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Este método permite que, al ingresar una consulta como \"A book to explore meditation and mindfulness practices.\", el sistema nos devuelva recomendaciones basadas en la cercanía semántica entre la consulta y las descripciones enriquecidas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Posteriormente, se experimenta con otros modelos de SentenceTransformer, como 'bert-large-nli-mean-tokens' y 'all-roberta-large-v1', para explorar diferentes formas de generar embeddings y ver cómo varían las recomendaciones con distintas arquitecturas. Cada modelo ofrece una perspectiva distinta sobre el significado de los textos, lo que puede ser muy útil para adaptar el recomendador a diversas necesidades o contextos.\n",
    "\n",
    "En resumen, este enfoque se basa en la idea de enriquecer la descripción de cada libro combinando varias fuentes de información (título, resumen, puntuación, categorías y autor) y utilizar modelos de SentenceTransformer para obtener representaciones vectoriales que capturen su significado. Con estas representaciones, podemos comparar la consulta del usuario con el contenido de cada libro y sugerir aquellos que son semánticamente más afines\n",

    "La columna \"description\" se crea para consolidar en un solo campo toda la información relevante de cada libro. Al concatenar el título, la descripción limpia, la puntuación media, las categorías y el autor, se obtiene un contexto completo y enriquecido para cada registro. Esto es crucial para la generación de embeddings, ya que permite al modelo capturar no solo el contenido textual del resumen, sino también otros aspectos importantes que definen el libro, como su autor y clasificación temática. En esencia, esta estrategia mejora la capacidad del sistema de recomendación para identificar similitudes semánticas entre libros, ya que dispone de una representación más rica y detallada del contenido de cada documento."

       "11561             In the rush of modern life, we tend to lose touch with the peace that is available in each moment. World-renowned Zen master, spiritual leader, and author Thich Nhat Hanh shows us how to make positive use of the very situations that usually pressure and antagonize us. For him a ringing telephone can be a signal to call us back to our true selves. Dirty dishes, red lights, and traffic jams are spiritual friends on the path to \"mindfulness\"â€”the process of keeping our consciousness alive to our present experience and reality. The most profound satisfactions, the deepest feelings of joy and completeness lie as close at hand as our next aware breath and the smile we can form right now.,Lucidly and beautifully written, ,Peace Is Every Step ,contains commentaries and meditations, personal anecdotes and stories from Nhat Hanh's experiences as a peace activist, teacher, and community leader. It begins where the reader already isâ€”in the kitchen, office, driving a car, walking a partâ€”and shows how deep meditative presence is available now. Nhat Hanh provides exercises to increase our awareness of our own body and mind through conscious breathing, which can bring immediate joy and peace. Nhat Hanh also shows how to be aware of relationships with others and of the world around us, its beauty and also its pollution and injustices. the deceptively simple practices of ,Peace Is Every Step, encourage the reader to work for peace in the world as he or she continues to work on sustaining inner peace by turning the \"mindless\" into the mindFUL.   \n",

The book is rich with real-life anecdotes and examines the nature of the TCK kid experience and its effects on maturing, developing a sense of identity, and adjusting to one's passport country upon return. The authors give readers an understanding of the challenges and benefits of the TCK life and provide practical suggestions and advice on maximizing those benefits.   \n",

From that exhilarating portrait, he takes us back more than two thousand years to the city's foundation, one mired in mythologies and superstitions that would inform Rome's development for centuries.,From the beginning, Rome was a hotbed of power, overweening ambition, desire, political genius, and corruption. Hughes details the turbulent years that saw the formation of empire and the establishment of the sociopolitical system, along the way providing colorful portraits of all the major figures, both political (Julius Caesar, Marcus Aurelius, Nero, Caligula) and cultural (Cicero, Martial, Virgil), to name just a few. For almost a thousand years, Rome would remain the most politically important, richest, and largest city in the Western world.,From the formation of empire, Hughes moves on to the rise of early Christianity, his own antipathy toward religion providing rich and lively context for the brutality of the early Church, and eventually the Crusades. The brutality had the desired effectâ€”the Church consolidated and outlasted the power of empire, and Rome would be the capital of the Papal States until its annexation into the newly united kingdom of Italy in 1870.,As one would expect, Hughes lavishes plenty of critical attention on the Renaissance, providing a full survey of the architecture, painting, and sculpture that blossomed in Rome over the course of the fourteenth through the sixteenth centuries, and shedding new light on old masters in the process. Having established itself as the artistic and spiritual center of the world, Rome in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries saw artists (and, eventually, wealthy tourists) from all over Europe converging on the bustling city, even while it was caught up in the nationalistic turmoils of the Italian independence struggle and war against France.,Hughes keeps the momentum going right into the twentieth century, when Rome witnessed the rise and fall of Italian Fascism and Mussolini, and took on yet another identity in the postwar years as the fashionable city of \"La Dolce Vita.\" This is the Rome Hughes himself first encountered, and it's one he contends, perhaps controversially, has been lost in the half century since, as the cult of mass tourism has slowly ruined the dazzling city he loved so much.

Ceram visualized archeology as a wonderful combination of high adventure, romance, history and scholarship, and this book, a chronicle of man's search for his past, reads like a dramatic narrative. We travel with Heinrich Schliemann as, defying the ridicule of the learned world, he actually unearths the remains of the ancient city of Troy. We share the excitement of Lord Carnarvon and Howard Carter as they first glimpse the riches of Tutankhamen's tomb, of George Smith when he found the ancient clay tablets that contained the records of the Biblical Flood. We rediscover the ruined splendors of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the wonders of the ancient wold; of Chichen Itza, the abandoned pyramids of the Maya: and the legendary Labyrinth of tile Minotaur in Crete. Here is much of the history of civilization and the stories of the men who rediscovered it.,From the Paperback edition.   \n",

But while this epic struggle forms the core of his work, Herodotus' natural curiosity frequently gives rise to colorful digressions - a description of the natural wonders of Egypt; an account of European lake-dwellers; and far-fetched accounts of dog-headed men and gold-digging ants. With its kaleidoscopic blend of fact and legend, the \"Histories\" offers a compelling Greek view of the world of the fifth century BC.   \n",

In A HISTORY OF ANCIENT BRITAIN Neil Oliver turns a spotlight on the very beginnings of the story of Britain; on the first people to occupy these islands and their battle for survival. ,There has been human habitation in Britain, regularly interrupted by Ice Ages, for the best part of a million years. The last retreat of the glaciers 12,000 years ago brought a new and warmer age and with it, one of the greatest tsunamis recorded on Earth which struck the north-east of Britain, devastating the population and flooding the low-lying plains of what is now the North Sea. The resulting island became, in time, home to a diverse range of cultures and peoples who have left behind them some of the most extraordinary and enigmatic monuments in the world.,Through what is revealed by the artefacts of the past, Neil Oliver weaves the epic story - half -a-million years of human history up to the departure of the Roman Empire in the Fifth Century AD. It was a period which accounts for more than ninety-nine per cent of humankind's presence on these islands.,It is the real story of Britain and of her people.   \n",

Why did the Buddha walk to Sarnath to give his first sermon? How did the Europeans map India?,The history of any country begins with its geography. With sparkling wit and intelligence, Sanjeev Sanyal sets off to explore India and look at how the countryâ€™s history was shaped by, among other things, its rivers, mountains and cities. Traversing remote mountain passes, visiting ancient archaeological sites, crossing rivers in shaky boats and immersing himself in old records and manuscripts, he considers questions about Indian history that we rarely ask: Why do Indians call their country Bharat? How did the British build the railways across the subcontinent? What was it like to sail on an Indian Ocean merchant ship in the fifth century AD? Why was the world's highest mountain named after George Everest?   \n",
       "3809   From Robert Hughes, one of the greatest art and cultural critics of our time, comes a sprawling, comprehensive, and deeply personal history of Romeâ€”as city, as empire, and, crucially, as an origin of Western art and civilization, two subjects about which Hughes has spent his life writing and thinking.,Starting on a personal note, Hughes takes us to the Rome he first encountered as a hungry twenty-one-year-old fresh from Australia in 1959. From that exhilarating portrait, he takes us back more than two thousand years to the city's foundation, one mired in mythologies and superstitions that would inform Rome's development for centuries.,From the beginning, Rome was a hotbed of power, overweening ambition, desire, political genius, and corruption. Hughes details the turbulent years that saw the formation of empire and the establishment of the sociopolitical system, along the way providing colorful portraits of all the major figures, both political (Julius Caesar, Marcus Aurelius, Nero, Caligula) and cultural (Cicero, Martial, Virgil), to name just a few. For almost a thousand years, Rome would remain the most politically important, richest, and largest city in the Western world.,From the formation of empire, Hughes moves on to the rise of early Christianity, his own antipathy toward religion providing rich and lively context for the brutality of the early Church, and eventually the Crusades. The brutality had the desired effectâ€”the Church consolidated and outlasted the power of empire, and Rome would be the capital of the Papal States until its annexation into the newly united kingdom of Italy in 1870.,As one would expect, Hughes lavishes plenty of critical attention on the Renaissance, providing a full survey of the architecture, painting, and sculpture that blossomed in Rome over the course of the fourteenth through the sixteenth centuries, and shedding new light on old masters in the process. Having established itself as the artistic and spiritual center of the world, Rome in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries saw artists (and, eventually, wealthy tourists) from all over Europe converging on the bustling city, even while it was caught up in the nationalistic turmoils of the Italian independence struggle and war against France.,Hughes keeps the momentum going right into the twentieth century, when Rome witnessed the rise and fall of Italian Fascism and Mussolini, and took on yet another identity in the postwar years as the fashionable city of \"La Dolce Vita.\" This is the Rome Hughes himself first encountered, and it's one he contends, perhaps controversially, has been lost in the half century since, as the cult of mass tourism has slowly ruined the dazzling city he loved so much. Equal parts idolizing, blasphemous, outraged, and awestruck, ,Rome ,is a portrait of the Eternal City as only Robert Hughes could paint it.   \n",

Ceram visualized archeology as a wonderful combination of high adventure, romance, history and scholarship, and this book, a chronicle of man's search for his past, reads like a dramatic narrative. We travel with Heinrich Schliemann as, defying the ridicule of the learned world, he actually unearths the remains of the ancient city of Troy. We share the excitement of Lord Carnarvon and Howard Carter as they first glimpse the riches of Tutankhamen's tomb, of George Smith when he found the ancient clay tablets that contained the records of the Biblical Flood. We rediscover the ruined splendors of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the wonders of the ancient wold of Chichen Itza, the abandoned pyramids of the Maya: and the legendary Labyrinth of tile Minotaur in Crete. Here is much of the history of civilization and the stories of the men who rediscovered it.,From the Paperback edition.   \n",

But while this epic struggle forms the core of his work, Herodotus' natural curiosity frequently gives rise to colorful digressions a description of the natural wonders of Egypt an account of European lakedwellers and farfetched accounts of dogheaded men and golddigging ants. With its kaleidoscopic blend of fact and legend, the Histories offers a compelling Greek view of the world of the fifth century BC.   \n",

The last retreat of the glaciers 12,000 years ago brought a new and warmer age and with it, one of the greatest tsunamis recorded on Earth which struck the northeast of Britain, devastating the population and flooding the lowlying plains of what is now the North Sea. The resulting island became, in time, home to a diverse range of cultures and peoples who have left behind them some of the most extraordinary and enigmatic monuments in the world.,Through what is revealed by the artefacts of the past, Neil Oliver weaves the epic story half amillion years of human history up to the departure of the Roman Empire in the Fifth Century AD. It was a period which accounts for more than ninetynine per cent of humankind's presence on these islands.,It is the real story of Britain and of her people.   \n",

With sparkling wit and intelligence, Sanjeev Sanyal sets off to explore India and look at how the countrys history was shaped by, among other things, its rivers, mountains and cities. Traversing remote mountain passes, visiting ancient archaeological sites, crossing rivers in shaky boats and immersing himself in old records and manuscripts, he considers questions about Indian history that we rarely ask: Why do Indians call their country Bharat How did the British build the railways across the subcontinent What was it like to sail on an Indian Ocean merchant ship in the fifth century AD Why was the world's highest mountain named after George Everest   \n",
       "3809   From Robert Hughes, one of the greatest art and cultural critics of our time, comes a sprawling, comprehensive, and deeply personal history of Romeas city, as empire, and, crucially, as an origin of Western art and civilization, two subjects about which Hughes has spent his life writing and thinking.,Starting on a personal note, Hughes takes us to the Rome he first encountered as a hungry twentyoneyearold fresh from Australia in 1959. From that exhilarating portrait, he takes us back more than two thousand years to the city's foundation, one mired in mythologies and superstitions that would inform Rome's development for centuries.,From the beginning, Rome was a hotbed of power, overweening ambition, desire, political genius, and corruption. Hughes details the turbulent years that saw the formation of empire and the establishment of the sociopolitical system, along the way providing colorful portraits of all the major figures, both political Julius Caesar, Marcus Aurelius, Nero, Caligula and cultural Cicero, Martial, Virgil, to name just a few. For almost a thousand years, Rome would remain the most politically important, richest, and largest city in the Western world.,From the formation of empire, Hughes moves on to the rise of early Christianity, his own antipathy toward religion providing rich and lively context for the brutality of the early Church, and eventually the Crusades. The brutality had the desired effectthe Church consolidated and outlasted the power of empire, and Rome would be the capital of the Papal States until its annexation into the newly united kingdom of Italy in 1870.,As one would expect, Hughes lavishes plenty of critical attention on the Renaissance, providing a full survey of the architecture, painting, and sculpture that blossomed in Rome over the course of the fourteenth through the sixteenth centuries, and shedding new light on old masters in the process. Having established itself as the artistic and spiritual center of the world, Rome in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries saw artists and, eventually, wealthy tourists from all over Europe converging on the bustling city, even while it was caught up in the nationalistic turmoils of the Italian independence struggle and war against France.,Hughes keeps the momentum going right into the twentieth century, when Rome witnessed the rise and fall of Italian Fascism and Mussolini, and took on yet another identity in the postwar years as the fashionable city of La Dolce Vita. This is the Rome Hughes himself first encountered, and it's one he contends, perhaps controversially, has been lost in the half century since, as the cult of mass tourism has slowly ruined the dazzling city he loved so much. Equal parts idolizing, blasphemous, outraged, and awestruck, ,Rome ,is a portrait of the Eternal City as only Robert Hughes could paint it.   \n",

Desc / Summary: C.W. Ceram visualized archeology as a wonderful combination of high adventure, romance, history and scholarship, and this book, a chronicle of man's search for his past, reads like a dramatic narrative. We travel with Heinrich Schliemann as, defying the ridicule of the learned world, he actually unearths the remains of the ancient city of Troy. We share the excitement of Lord Carnarvon and Howard Carter as they first glimpse the riches of Tutankhamen's tomb, of George Smith when he found the ancient clay tablets that contained the records of the Biblical Flood. We rediscover the ruined splendors of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the wonders of the ancient wold of Chichen Itza, the abandoned pyramids of the Maya: and the legendary Labyrinth of tile Minotaur in Crete. Here is much of the history of civilization and the stories of the men who rediscovered it.,From the Paperback edition.. Average Rating: 4.24.

Desc / Summary: Who were the first Britons, and what sort of world did they occupy In A HISTORY OF ANCIENT BRITAIN Neil Oliver turns a spotlight on the very beginnings of the story of Britain on the first people to occupy these islands and their battle for survival. ,There has been human habitation in Britain, regularly interrupted by Ice Ages, for the best part of a million years. The last retreat of the glaciers 12,000 years ago brought a new and warmer age and with it, one of the greatest tsunamis recorded on Earth which struck the northeast of Britain, devastating the population and flooding the lowlying plains of what is now the North Sea. The resulting island became, in time, home to a diverse range of cultures and peoples who have left behind them some of the most extraordinary and enigmatic monuments in the world.,Through what is revealed by the artefacts of the past, Neil Oliver weaves the epic story half amillion years of human history up to the departure of the Roman Empire in the Fifth Century AD. It was a period which accounts for more than ninetynine per cent of humankind's presence on these islands.,It is the real story of Britain and of her people.. Average Rating: 4.17.

       "3809   Title: Rome: A Cultural, Visual, and Personal History. Desc / Summary: From Robert Hughes, one of the greatest art and cultural critics of our time, comes a sprawling, comprehensive, and deeply personal history of Romeas city, as empire, and, crucially, as an origin of Western art and civilization, two subjects about which Hughes has spent his life writing and thinking.,Starting on a personal note, Hughes takes us to the Rome he first encountered as a hungry twentyoneyearold fresh from Australia in 1959. From that exhilarating portrait, he takes us back more than two thousand years to the city's foundation, one mired in mythologies and superstitions that would inform Rome's development for centuries.,From the beginning, Rome was a hotbed of power, overweening ambition, desire, political genius, and corruption. Hughes details the turbulent years that saw the formation of empire and the establishment of the sociopolitical system, along the way providing colorful portraits of all the major figures, both political Julius Caesar, Marcus Aurelius, Nero, Caligula and cultural Cicero, Martial, Virgil, to name just a few. For almost a thousand years, Rome would remain the most politically important, richest, and largest city in the Western world.,From the formation of empire, Hughes moves on to the rise of early Christianity, his own antipathy toward religion providing rich and lively context for the brutality of the early Church, and eventually the Crusades. The brutality had the desired effectthe Church consolidated and outlasted the power of empire, and Rome would be the capital of the Papal States until its annexation into the newly united kingdom of Italy in 1870.,As one would expect, Hughes lavishes plenty of critical attention on the Renaissance, providing a full survey of the architecture, painting, and sculpture that blossomed in Rome over the course of the fourteenth through the sixteenth centuries, and shedding new light on old masters in the process. Having established itself as the artistic and spiritual center of the world, Rome in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries saw artists and, eventually, wealthy tourists from all over Europe converging on the bustling city, even while it was caught up in the nationalistic turmoils of the Italian independence struggle and war against France.,Hughes keeps the momentum going right into the twentieth century, when Rome witnessed the rise and fall of Italian Fascism and Mussolini, and took on yet another identity in the postwar years as the fashionable city of La Dolce Vita. This is the Rome Hughes himself first encountered, and it's one he contends, perhaps controversially, has been lost in the half century since, as the cult of mass tourism has slowly ruined the dazzling city he loved so much. Equal parts idolizing, blasphemous, outraged, and awestruck, ,Rome ,is a portrait of the Eternal City as only Robert Hughes could paint it.. Average Rating: 3.82.

    "## 6.4. Estudio del Error\n",
    "\n",
    "En el campo de los sistemas de recomendación, la evaluación del error es un desafío particular, ya que no se cuenta con métricas directas y universales como en problemas de clasificación. Durante el desarrollo del proyecto, hemos estudiado diversas técnicas de evaluación para recomendadores, y a continuación, presentamos un resumen de estas metodologías.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluación Offline\n",
    "\n",
    "En un primer enfoque, se pueden utilizar evaluaciones offline, que consisten en dividir el dataset en conjuntos de entrenamiento y prueba. Aunque esta metodología es común en tareas de clasificación, en sistemas de recomendación se adaptan métricas específicas, tales como:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hit Rate y Precision@K:** Miden la frecuencia con la que los ítems recomendados incluyen aquellos que el usuario ha consumido o valorado positivamente.\n",
    "- **NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain):** Valora la posición de los ítems relevantes en la lista de recomendaciones, penalizando aquellos que aparecen en posiciones inferiores.\n",
    "- **MAP (Mean Average Precision):** Proporciona una medida global de la precisión, considerando la relevancia de las recomendaciones en distintos niveles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estas métricas ofrecen una valoración cuantitativa de la calidad del sistema sin requerir pruebas en un entorno en vivo.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A/B Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "En este método, se presentan diferentes versiones del recomendador a distintos grupos de usuarios y se comparan sus rendimientos basados en métricas reales, como:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tasa de Conversión:** Proporción de usuarios que realizan una acción deseada, por ejemplo, seleccionar un libro recomendado.\n",
    "- **Tiempo de Interacción:** Duración de la sesión o tiempo dedicado a explorar las recomendaciones.\n",
    "- **Feedback Directo:** Valoraciones o comentarios proporcionados por los usuarios sobre la utilidad de las recomendaciones.\n",
    "\n",
    "El A/B testing permite validar en condiciones reales cómo interactúan los usuarios con el sistema y ajustar, en consecuencia, parámetros o estrategias de recomendación.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedback en Tiempo Real y Modelos de Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Otra línea de investigación que hemos estudiado es el uso del feedback en tiempo real, el cual busca adaptar las recomendaciones en función de la interacción inmediata del usuario. Este enfoque puede incluir técnicas de **reinforcement learning**, donde el sistema aprende a optimizar sus sugerencias basándose en recompensas derivadas de comportamientos como clicks o conversiones. Esta técnica muestra un potencial elevado para mejorar la personalización y actualmente se encuentra en una fase exploratoria para muchos escenarios de recomendación.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Consideraciones Finales\n",
    "\n",
    "Si bien hemos investigado estas técnicas de evaluación para sistemas de recomendación, un análisis exhaustivo del error en este contexto resulta complejo y se escapa del alcance de este trabajo. Por ello, hemos decidido enfocar nuestro estudio del error en el clasificador basado en LSTM, donde contamos con métricas claras como precisión y pérdida.\n",
    "\n",
    "En resumen, hemos estudiado metodologías como la evaluación offline, A/B testing y el feedback en tiempo real para mejorar la calidad de los recomendadores. Sin embargo, dado que estas técnicas requieren un enfoque más profundo y específico, las consideramos líneas de investigación futuras para perfeccionar nuestros sistemas de recomendación."
